# TENSync
A hardware+library platform for synchronizing electrophysiology across DBS, EEG, video, and multimodal physiology measures.

## Overview
In our lab we work with the Activa PC+S, a bidirectional DBS stimulator that enables simultaneous stimulation and recording. As a part of our work we need to record from various systems and synchronize/time align the recordings.

One way of doing so is to add an external stimulation artifact, like from a commercial TENS unit, and then using the resulting stimulation to time align across recordings.

This script and associated hardware enables such a time-alignment.
